    <p>The number π (/paɪ/; spelled out as "pi") is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's
        circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159. The number π appears in many formulae across
        mathematics and physics. It is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of
        two integers, although fractions such as
        22
        7 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {22}{7}}} are commonly used to approximate it. Consequently, its decimal representation
        never ends, nor enters a permanently repeating pattern. It is a transcendental number, meaning that it cannot be
        a solution of an equation involving only finite sums, products, powers, and integers. The transcendence of π
        implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and
        straightedge. The decimal digits of π appear to be randomly distributed,[a] but no proof of this conjecture has
        been found.For thousands of years, mathematicians have attempted to extend their understanding of π, sometimes
        by computing
        its value to a high degree of accuracy. Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Babylonians, required
        fairly accurate approximations of π for practical computations. Around 250 BC, the Greek mathematician
        Archimedes created an algorithm to approximate π with arbitrary accuracy. In the 5th century AD, Chinese
        mathematicians approximated π to seven digits, while Indian mathematicians made a five-digit approximation, both
        using geometrical techniques. The firs</p>

    <p>A <a href="crypto.html">cryptocurrency</a>, crypto-currency, or crypto[a] is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange
        through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold
        or maintain it.Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong
        cryptography to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of
        coin ownership.[3][4][5] Despite the term that has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that
        have been created, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense, and varying
        legal treatments have been applied to them in various jurisdicitons, including classification as commodities,
        securities, and currencies. Cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in
        practice.[6][7][8] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model,
        owners put up their tokens as collateral. </p>
